This projects deals with the study of the intrinsic dimension of objective landscapes through constraints applied in the space of network parameters. The investigation regards how many degrees of freedom (network parameters) are strictly necessary to solve a certain task almost as good as the standard unconstrained model.

The code for this project is based on the notebook "Autograd and Modules" from the course of "Deep Learning and Applied Artificial Intelligence" held by Prof. Rodol√†:

As in the notebook the selected task is the classification of hand written digits contained in the MNIST, by means of a MLP.
